# Tower OSS

``tower`` is the codename of an internal [Vocalizando](https://github.com/vocalizando/) project that's used to deploy
various projects.

The objective of Tower OSS is to create a simple, extensible, easy-to-deploy and open source platform to deploy GitHub
projects to a server.

## Scope

- Tower is not meant to be used to deploy various projects: a Tower instance can only be attached to a GitHub project.
- Tower is not meant to give full logs of a failed-deployment, just show an error in case a build fails.

## Usage
(TODO; see ``docs/`` for some documentation)
